# Tsukuyomi Watch — feature and file notes

PS-002 · Team PF-K96JPZ · Prepared 30 October 2026 (IST)

Live app: https://tsukuyomi-watch.vercel.app
Repository: https://github.com/PECathon-2026/Team-PF-K96JPZ

## 1. Explain the project in 30 seconds

Tsukuyomi Watch helps an observer choose a place, choose a celestial event and inspect a space image. It combines a stargazing map and nighttime weather ranking, a lunar-style event calendar, conservative local AI image restoration, and interactive comparison tools in a Japanese-inspired interface. Bonus tools retrieve NASA archival images, screen measurement CSVs and reward self-reported observations.

## 2. What each feature does

### The Watchtower — where to observe

Watchtower means a lookout used to observe what is around you. Here it is the location finder. Search a city worldwide, use your location, or select a spot on the scroll-style interactive map. Choose a radius and sort by distance or forecast score. Shrine, temple, mountain and observatory icons represent curated destinations.

City suggestions and observing spots are different datasets. City search uses Open-Meteo/GeoNames and returns up to 20 name matches worldwide. It is not limited to the six stored observing destinations. Selecting a city sets the center for finding those nearby destinations; it does not turn every city into a verified dark-sky site. Provider spelling/coverage can affect results.

For a selected destination, the app retrieves the next future nighttime weather hour: cloud cover, humidity, visibility and supporting temperature/wind. This is a forecast, not a live sensor measurement. The score is a weather heuristic:

Score = round(100 × [40(1 − cloud%/100) + 20 min(visibilityKm/20, 1) + 15(1 − humidity%/100)] / 75)

Example: 50% clouds, 10 km visibility and 50% humidity produces 50/100. Visibility caps at 20 km. Moonlight and light pollution are not included today; do not claim that this score proves ideal astronomical seeing or darkness.

### Moon tracker and reminders

Shows moon phase, illumination and location-specific rise/set data. A missing polar rise or set remains missing rather than being invented. Displays observer-timezone-aware messages such as a moonrise tonight. Local reminders show toasts while the app is open. Calendar exports can be imported into a user's calendar.

Persistent browser push is a separate delivery path: opt in, register an anonymous device, create/cancel jobs, then a scheduler delivers due jobs through Web Push. It requires HTTPS, permission, VAPID credentials, a running API and a periodic scheduler. Do not promise closed-app delivery without verifying the scheduler and a physical device receipt; browser power policies can delay it. Safari endpoints are not enabled in the current allowlist.

### The Celestial Scroll — when to observe

Celestial means related to the sky; a scroll is a rolled manuscript. This is the space event tracker: moon phases, launches, calculated eclipses and approximate meteor windows. Filter types/dates and navigate a real Japanese Kyūreki lunar month, including leap months, or switch to Gregorian view. Open details inside the app and export calendar reminders.

Phase times retain source UTC instants. Launch times can change. Eclipse maxima describe global events rather than local contacts. Meteor windows are recurring approximate dates, with ±1 day labels and noon UTC placeholders, not exact yearly peaks. Event filtering uses UTC civil dates; displayed times use the observer's timezone.

### ISS pass panel

Predicts visible ISS segments for the selected site from fresh CelesTrak orbital elements and SGP4 propagation. It samples the next three days, requires station elevation ≥10°, observer Sun below −6°, and fully sunlit station segments. Stale/invalid data is rejected. These are predictions with sampling/orbit/atmospheric limits, not guaranteed sightings.

### The Spirit Lens — clean and inspect an image

Spirit Lens is a poetic name for a lens revealing faint details. Choose a PNG, JPEG or WebP (up to 12 MB / 24 megapixels). The browser makes an RGB preview whose longest edge is at most 768px, detects source candidates on the original preview and runs a real pretrained DnCNN denoising model locally in a Web Worker with ONNX WASM. Model files are verified with SHA-256 hashes.

Gentle and Balanced settings blend the inferred luminance conservatively, limiting channel changes and protecting detected source regions. Optional six-iteration Richardson–Lucy deconvolution reduces an assumed Gaussian blur; the PSF is user-selected and wrong settings can cause ringing. Richardson–Lucy is a conventional method, not a second AI model.

Local processing keeps selected image pixels off the API server. Bounded edits reduce risk but cannot guarantee preservation of every faint feature. FITS/RAW, 16-bit PNG and full-resolution scientific restoration are not supported. The model is pretrained, not trained from scratch by this team.

### Dojo visualization — understand the result

Dojo means a place of practice/training. The problem statement's visualization interface is implemented inside Spirit Lens: drag the before/after divider, zoom/pan, toggle candidate overlays, inspect brightness/size/morphology and download a restored PNG or JSON report.

Star and galaxy labels are candidates, not confirmed catalogue identities. Nebulae and blended sources can look galaxy-like. Brightness is uncalibrated pixel information, not astronomical magnitude. SSIM/PSNR compare output with the noisy input, not with clean ground truth; a high value alone does not prove scientific accuracy.

### NASA SkyView import — archival sky data

Find a target/name or sky coordinate and request a supported survey/field width. The app imports a bounded 512px archival display JPEG with source provenance, then restores it through the same local pipeline. This is on-demand archive retrieval, not a live camera/telescope stream. The provider can be overloaded; local upload remains available.

### Signal Observatory — measurement screening

An observatory is a place for studying the sky. Upload a light-curve CSV (time_utc,flux,error) or spectrum CSV (wavelength_nm,flux,error), up to 1 MB / 12–2000 rows. The optional error column must be consistently populated. Explicit timezones, unique coordinates and complete values are required.

Robust median/MAD screening flags unusual measurements; spectra use a local baseline. Supplied uncertainty contributes to the threshold. Charts, settings and candidate JSON can be inspected/exported. Synthetic examples are labeled. These are follow-up candidates, not confirmed discoveries or formal scientific significance; a spectrum alone cannot establish time variability.

### Honor journal — encourage observation

Record a past event you actually observed and earn 25 Honor Points once per event. Points derive from local journal entries; badges unlock at 25, 100 and 250 points. Export JSON to keep a copy. This is self-reported, editable device-local storage, not a verified leaderboard or account-synced cloud ledger. The /dojo route displays this journal; the image comparison viewer is in Spirit Lens.

### Themes, meanings and navigation notes

Four motif palettes: Ink Wash (Tsukuyomi), Torii Crimson (Akatsuki), Sakura Rose and Katana Black/Gold. Light/dark mode is independent of the palette. Shared motifs, moon cues, animations and reduced-motion controls support the visual identity. Japanese characters reveal English meanings on hover/focus/touch. Navigation notes explain both each section's name and its function on hover/keyboard focus.

## 3. Architecture and request flows

Planning: React UI → React Query/tRPC client → same-origin /trpc proxy → Express/tRPC input validation → feature service → provider and/or Drizzle/Neon → typed response → UI.

City suggestions: search input → /api/cities on Vercel → fixed Open-Meteo geocoding host → validated city results. Catalogue lookup is independent on the API so one failing dependency does not hide the other.

Image: local file/archive import → validated preview → local worker → verified DnCNN → bounded blend / optional deblur → comparison, candidates and downloads. Selected local image pixels do not go to the backend.

Push: opted-in anonymous device → hashed ownership + stored subscription/jobs → periodic scheduler with a private credential → claimed/retried jobs → browser push service → service-worker notification.

Data: current locations/weather/events/feed bookkeeping and push jobs persist in PostgreSQL. Image previews/results remain in the current browser session. Themes/reminders/Honor use browser storage. User/account/Honor database tables are foundations, not evidence of completed authentication or cloud sync.

## 4. Verification and honest scope

Updated automated run: 31/31 test cases passed across nine test files, including three new worldwide city-search cases. See test-results-current.txt. Frontend/API production builds passed. The older detailed judging deck preserves the previous 28-case audit; it is historical evidence, not the current count.

Tests cover missing nighttime forecasts, score bounds, polar moon data, UTC/leap/lunar dates, invalid orbital elements, ICS escaping, unsafe push endpoints, bounded image changes, flat skies, malformed image headers, known deblur fixtures, bad CSVs and duplicate/future observations.

Remaining evidence gaps: measured code coverage, CI, broad cross-browser/permission/offline E2E, physical closed-app push receipt, concurrency/load validation, a full accessibility audit, astronomy-domain benchmarks and measured user impact. Ready for a controlled hackathon demo; not certified for always-on production or scientific discovery.

## 6. Quick panel answers

- Why is a city not a destination? A city is a search origin; a destination is a curated observing location with its own data and access context.
- What is innovative? The connected observing workflow, local inspectable AI and culturally coherent interface; underlying models/astronomy algorithms are established.
- Why tRPC plus Zod? Shared compile-time contracts reduce client/server drift; runtime validation still checks untrusted input.
- Is there live telescope video? No. SkyView supplies archival survey images.
- Does the AI prove missing detail? No. It denoises conservatively and offers inspection; fidelity needs domain validation.
- Is Honor secure against its owner editing storage? No. It is a private self-reported practice journal.
- Does the existence of an auth route mean login works? No. Provider discovery is scaffolding; complete callback/session/account sync is future work.
- What should we demo? City search/map, selected-site forecast, lunar events/internal details, labelled image restoration/slider/overlays, then one bonus and the test evidence.
